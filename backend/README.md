# About

Senior Design Project of redesigning of the website : [The ArQive](http://thearqive.com/)
Still In Development

# Rules
Contribution Rules

✔️ Never work on master or production branch!

⚠️ Be sure to branch off the development branch for features WIP

⚠️ Branch off of the production branch for hot fixes


✔️ Create a new branch for each set of related bugs or set of related tasks, naming by:


type_PascalCase, example: feat_CareerPage, bug_CareerEmail.


Common short type tokens: wip (work in progress), feat (feature or design), bug (bug fixes)


💻 command to create new branch locally: git checkout -b bug_CareerEmail


⚠️ Important: Before creating a branch, check if someone already started to work on this task and if there's already a branch created for this task, and if there is, please checkout and track the branch with the 💻 command: git checkout --track origin/bug_CareerEmail


--track shorthand for git checkout -b [branch] [remotename]/[branch] where remote name is origin and branch is the specific branch you're pulling from the origin remote


Right after creating a new branch, push it to remote to make it available for everyone, defining the upstream


💻 command: git push -u origin bug_CareerEmail


✔️ Everyday after working, push your local branch updates to remote branch.


⚠️ Important: make sure you're on the correct branch... and push


With 💻 command: git push


✔️ Finished with the task and want to merge?


Fix conflicts if needed, usually happens when more than 1 developer is working on the same file on different branches - communicate with the other developer to make sure their work was not removed


Please make the merge/pull request with as much detail about what you've done/added.


Or lead will merge your branch to master for you. Just ask!

# GlobaltraQs

developmental version: http://globaltraqsdev.com/

# Setup guide


   Download Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS iso from Ubuntu's Official site
   it should look like this: ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso

   Download and install Virtual box on your machine
   (I haven't tried it with VMware yet, but should be too different)

   Create a new machine:
   	-Name: thearqive (this will be its name inside of VirtualBox)
	-Type: Linux
	-Version: Ubuntu64
   Memory size:
   	-2 GB works for me you can do 4 GB if you want.
   	-The production server only uses 2 GB I think
   Hard Disk:
   	-Select create virtual hard disk
	Then choose:
	-Virtualbox Disk Image
   	Then you can choose between fixed or dynamic
	(I choose fixed that means it will ALWAYS take the same amount of space on your hard disk
	but be faster to access.  We won't need much more than 15G so I would take the performance
	over the need to add more.  The server will be pretty light weigh in terms of storage.
	Either way it shouldn't make much of a diff)
	- Fixed
	File Location and size:
	-15GB should be more than enough space

Now your VM has been provisioned and it is ready for you to install linux, Ubuntu specifically.

	Click start with the VM you just created selected.
	It will ask you for an ISO file to boot from.
	Choose the Ubuntu ISO you DLed earlier: ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso

INSTALLING UBUNTU SEVER 22.04:
	Choose the top option to Install Ubuntu from a Live Disk

	A bunch of tests will run

	Language:
		English

	Keyboard Config:
		English , English

	Type of Install:
		Ubuntu Server NOT minimized

	Network Config:
		Should look like:
		en0s3 eth
		DHCPv4 10.0.2.15 (the ip add doesn't matter its what ever was available)

	If your ethernet config did work out automatically that means something with virtualbox
	isn't configured right. Look it up, should be straight forward but OS (Mac / Windows)
	specific.

	Configure Proxy:
		Dont eneter anything here just hit done

	Configure Ubuntu Archive Mirror:
		the defualt selection is good, hit done

	Storage Config:
		The defualts here are good too, yes use entire disk
		(this is the disk image you created not your actual hard drive)

	The next screen explains the partitions:
		Hit done, defualts are fine

	Profile set up (IMPORTANT this will set your username and password)
		Yourname: (up to you, doesn't really matter)
		Server Name: thearqive (you can make it something different if you want but for simplicity something short)
		username: I just use my same username across the board
		password: doesn't have to be too special this wont be too open to the outside world

		hit done

	SSH Setup:

		yes! [X] 'Install OpenSSH Server' check this box using the spacebar
		you dont need to import an identity

		hit done

	Featured Server Snaps:
		no thanks :)
		hit done

	Now its gonna take a minute, downloading, configuring and installing packages.
	When its says 'Cancel update and Reboot' hit enter, if it get through the updates dont worry you're one step ahead

	It'll hang when it gets to 'Failed unmounting Optical / CD-ROM'
	hit enter and the system will reboot.

	After the first initialization of the server its gonna spit out this long hash, hit enter and you should see:

	(your_server_name) login: enter your username and password

	welcome to your very own linux install!

	now follow the next steps to get the server running.



0. Update and Download repos

    `sudo apt-get update`

    `sudo apt -y upgrade`
	-might ask you to restart some services, do it

    `git clone https://github.com/kennardlim1220/thearqive-backend.git`
	- You might need a git token, go to your github profile and get one save it locally
	- enter your username and then use the token as your password

    `git clone https://github.com/kennardlim1220/arQive-frontend.git`
	- same here

1. Install python3.7 and pip 3

    Navigate to home dir

    `cd ~`

    Get latest from server

    `sudo apt update`

    Add third party repo for python 3.7

    `sudo apt install software-properties-common`

    `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa`
	- this sometimes takes a minute cause it's a third pary repo (not official) hit enter to install

    Install python3 from repo

    `sudo apt install python3.7`

    Use `python3.7 -V` to verify python 3.7.x has been installed

    Install pip3

    `sudo apt install -y python3-pip`

    Use `pip3 -V` to verify pip has been installed

2. Install and setup Postgresql

    Get build essentials

    `sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3.7-dev python3-virtualenv python3.7-distutils libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib`

    Start DB - Use the following line to start DB everytime you restart Linux

    `sudo service postgresql start`

    Log in to postgres

    `sudo -i -u postgres`

    Start psql

    `psql`

    Create a new DB

    `CREATE DATABASE devdb;`

    Create a new user for DB

    `CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'adminpassword';`

    Adjust user settings

    `ALTER ROLE admin SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';`

    `ALTER ROLE admin SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';`

    `ALTER ROLE admin SET timezone TO 'UTC';`

    Make your new user an admin of your new DB

    `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE devdb TO admin;`

    (you can make you own db name, username, and password, these will change in production builds for security, be sure to remember your info for creating superusers)

    Quit psql

    `\q`

    Exit postgres

    `exit`

3. Create Python virtual environment

    Change to home directory
    `cd ~`

    Create a python3.7 virtual environment called env
    `virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.7 env`

    Activate virtual environment
    `source env/bin/activate`

    Check version of python should output: Python 3.7.14
    `python --version`

    // python3.7 -m pip install --upgrade pip

4. Install django and dependencies
    Navigate to ~/thearqive-backend
    `cd thearqive-backend`

    Install project requirements

    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (this command crashes on installing psycopg2 but also installs psycopg2-binary which is a working fix)

    Install missing dependencies

    `pip3 install psycopg2-binary python-decouple djangorestframework jinja2 boto3 djangorestframework-api-key django-rest-knox django-restql django-decouple Pillow`

5. Update settings.ini

    Edit settings.ini in ~/thearqive-backend/GlobalTraqs/

    `nano ~/thearqive-backend/GlobalTraqs/settings.ini`

    Can copy and paste from below or fill in your own.

    [settings]

    DEBUG=True

    SECRET_KEY=''

    NAME: devdb

    USER: admin

    PASSWORD: adminpassword

    HOST: localhost

    PORT: 5432

    EMAIL_USE_TLS=True

    EMAIL_PORT= 587

    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'resetglobaltraqs@gmail.com'

    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'nmjpfuuvopvbmeri'

    (again these values will change for deployments)

    ctrl + x, y, then enter to save

6. Migrate, Create a superuser, and Start backend
   Note:this is a temporary commit from Kennard but if you are on the Ubuntu server, you must:
   1. `nano ./Globaltraqs/Globaltraqs/settings.py` (File inside 1 layer deeper than setting.ini)
   2. add '*' to allowed host and save the file (ctrl x, y, enter)
   3. shutdown the virtual machine
   4. In Virtual Box, click settings -> Network and change NAT to Bridged Adapter
   5. Turn on the virtual machine
   6. use `ip addr` to get your virtual machine ip address. Look for inet to get your ip address.
      - If you only have inet6 (ipv6), turn off the machine, change it back to NAT, turn it on, turn it off, change it back to bridge, and turn it on again.
      - If that doesn't work, come to the meeting.
      - Ignore this if you are using the Ubuntu Desktop
    In /thearqive-backend/Globaltraqs/

    Set up DJANGO migrations

    `python3 manage.py makemigrations`

    Migrate DJANGO to DB

    `python3 manage.py migrate`

    Create a superuser to login to DJANGO backend

    `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` - Make it simple and obvious for local dev

    Start DJANGO backend

    `python3 manage.py runserver`
    
    - If you are using Kennard's optional instruction, then run `python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000` instead.
    - To access, use the virtual machine ip address. My virtual machine ip was 192.168.1.183, so I would use `http://192.168.1.183:8000` in my host machine browser.

7. Generate API key for frontend

    With the DJANGO server running from the previous step, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and log in with the superuser account you made

    Generate a new API key (any expiration date)

    Copy the key (including the prefix) from the yellow pop up at the top of the page

    Add the key to frontend .env file (ssh into arqive server and retrieve the correct env from /carterb/)

8. Create user groups - This section is a WIP

    With the DJANGO server running from the previous step, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and log in with the superuser account you made

    Go to Authentication and Authorization

    Create new groups for Administrators, Moderators, and Anonymous with aproriate permissions assigned

    Work in Progress: No definite answers for which exact permissions to add, I assume admins get all permissions and anonymous gets none

9. Add categories for pins in DB

    Exit virtual environment or open a new terminal

    `cd ~`

    Login to postgres

    `sudo -i -u postgres`

    Start psql

    `psql`

    Connect to DB you made

    `\c devdb`

    At categories using SQL

    `INSERT INTO pins_categorytype VALUES (1, 'Personal', '');`

    `INSERT INTO pins_categorytype VALUES (2, 'Historical', '');`

    `INSERT INTO pins_categorytype VALUES (3, 'Community', '');`

    Quit psql

    `\q`

    exit postgres

    `exit`

10. Populate DB with pre-made stories

    Make sure your in GlobaltraQs/GlobalTraqs

    Enter DJANGO shell

    `python3 manage.py shell`

    Start python script to populate DB

    `exec(open('old_story_upload.py').read())`

11. Start Frontend

    In a new terminal open the arQive-frontend dir

    Download nodejs

    `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x -o nodesource_setup.sh`

    `sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh`

    Install nodejs

    `sudo apt install nodejs`

    Install node modules

    `npm install`

    Start frontend

    `npm start`
